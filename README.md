IoT-Driven Fleet Optimization (Case Study 1):
Challenge: Focuses on inefficiencies in logistics and fleet management, specifically suboptimal route planning, excessive fuel consumption, and delayed deliveries.
Solution: Involves using IoT for real-time data access, route optimization, fuel monitoring, and predictive maintenance to reduce costs and improve delivery times.
Value: Resulted in significant improvements in fuel efficiency, delivery times, shipment delays, and overall operational efficiency.
IoT-Driven Predictive Maintenance (Case Study 2):
Challenge: Addresses unplanned vehicle breakdowns, fleet downtime, and reactive maintenance strategies, which caused delivery delays and increased operational costs.
Solution: Focuses on using IoT sensors for real-time vehicle health monitoring and predictive maintenance to prevent breakdowns and optimize maintenance schedules.
Value: Delivered cost savings by reducing maintenance costs, increasing fleet uptime, and improving on-time deliveries and logistics performance.
